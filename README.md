# NeuralNets
Repository containing the different projects relevant to neural networks and exploring it's usability and functionality


## Autoencoders
In this notebook, we can see an introduction to autoencoders and its main functions and usabilities. We will explore different types of autoencoders architecture and the main advantages and disadvantages of each one of them. To test and try the different models, we will use the MNIST dataset.


## Object Localization
The main objective of this notebook is to serve as an introduction of an object locator model. To test and explore the functionalities of these tyes of models, we will use the FashionMNIST dataset.
